Z. Esra Ilhan is a postdoctoral researcher specializing in the human microbial ecology and metabolome. She obtained her Ph.D. degree from Arizona State University in Microbiology in 2016. Her Ph.D. studies focused on the global problem of obesity and the role of gut microorganisms in human energy balance after different types of bariatric surgeries. After graduation, she worked at the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix to study the adverse and commensal roles of microorganisms on female reproductive tract health. She has expertise in genetic and metabolic characterization of the human microbiota, host-microbe interactions using 3-D epithelial cell models, and anaerobic bacteriology. Esra joined the PhylHom group in 2019 to study the reciprocal interactions between xenobiotics and the gut microbiome that can be leveraged to the development of personalized medicine approaches.
