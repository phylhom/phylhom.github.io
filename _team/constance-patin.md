After graduating with a Master 2 in Genomics and Environment at Universit√© Paris-Saclay, I am currently in the second year of my PhD at the ITFA graduate school. This thesis is co-financed by an ANR and the AlimH department of INRAE. The study focuses on the interactions between major bacterial species found in the gut microbiota, of a cohort of premature babies, and the host. The impact of xenobiotics on this dialogue will then be evaluated.
