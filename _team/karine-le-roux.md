Karine Le Roux works as a research technician at INRAE since 2008. She has a wide range of technical skills ranging from microbiology to molecular and cellular biology, allowing her to set up studies of interactions between micro-organisms and the host (human and animal). In the PhylHom team, her main research topics focus on the study of the microbiota in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease. Her main activity includes the extraction of nucleic acids from complex samples, as well as the quantification of bacterial groups by molecular biology.

As a laboratory manager, she ensures the maintenance of the team's biological, material and computer resources as well as the training and technical supervision of trainees and outsiders.
