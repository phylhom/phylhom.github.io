After graduating in 2021 with a Master 2 in Genomics and Environment at Universit√© Paris-Saclay, I am currently in the first year of my PhD at the ITFA graduate school.

The thesis focuses on the mechanisms of adaptation of the microbiome to chronic exposure to xenobiotics and the impact on the secondary response to treatments.
