After the completion of my master program in Biomedical Omics at the University of Milan - Statale, I worked in the field of microbiota and cancer immunotherapy in the European Institute of Oncology (IEO). I am currently in my first year of doctoral school with ITFA.

My thesis focuses on the ecotoxic effects of EDCs on human microbiota communities, the characterization of bacterial transformation mechanisms and the effects of this interaction on host health. The aim of the project is then to propose nutritional strategies to tackle this interaction and restore homeostasis.
