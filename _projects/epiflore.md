### Epiflore "Intestinal ecosystem of large and very premature babies: microbiota analysis, short and long term clinical implications"

Partners: MJ Butel (Univ Paris V, Coord.), PY Ancel (INSERM U953)

Funding: ANR Blanc 2013

The purpose of the EPIFLORE project is to conduct a large-scale analysis of microbiota establishment in the preterm infant. This project takes advantage of the opportunity of 2 French cohorts that started in 2011: (1) EPIPAGE 2 which included all premature infants born in France and (2) ELFE which included all term newborns and preterm infants of high gestational age. All children included will be followed up to 12 years old. The EPIFLORE project has three objectives: (1) to study on a large scale the specific intestinal microbiota of very premature newborns with a multicentric approach taking into account the interindividual variability and the variability linked to the center, (2) to link the great prematurity with development of short and longer-term pathologies; and (3) to look for relationships between the microbiota profile and the development of sepsis or NEC. Six hundred and sixty children from 19 level III intensive care centers and belonging to the EPIPAGE 2 cohort were included. The comparison of the children belonging to these 2 cohorts will make it possible to determine the risk for a very premature baby to develop pathologies in the short and long term.
