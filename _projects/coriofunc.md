The main objective of the CorioFunc project is to study the impact of bacterial conversion of cholesterol-derived compounds on the lipid metabolism of the host and the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by bacteria of Coriobacteriaceae family.

Recent work on experimental models has shown that the prevalence of 16S rDNA sequences assigned to Coriobacteriaceae family is a function of the genotype of the host and positively correlated with hepatic triglyceride levels and non-HDL cholesterol plasma levels. Although still poorly studied, the metabolism of bile acids by intestinal microorganisms is considered a factor that strongly influences the lipid metabolism of the host. We have recently demonstrated, using microbiota transfer experiments in a murine model, the key role played by the gut microbiota in the development of liver pathologies (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). However, the molecular mechanisms associated with this effect are still poorly described. In addition, the metabolism of endogenous corticosteroids by intestinal bacteria is also poorly known.

The combination of expertise specific to the French and German teams involved in the CorioFunc project will allow us to characterize the ecological and patho-physiological importance of Coriobacteriaceae within the intestinal ecosystem and more generally on a systemic scale.
