RESTOGUT. Restoring autophagy to eliminate the deleterious effects of the Western diet and colonization by pathogenic bacteria on intestinal homeostasis 

Polymorphisms in autophagy genes leading to dysregulated autophagy, the Western diet and abnormal colonization of the ileal mucosa by adherent and invasive E. coli (AIEC) have been identified as risk factors for Crohn's disease (CD). This project aims to (i) investigate the effect of Western diet on autophagy, (ii) examine the impact of the combination of Western diet and host genetic susceptibility (deregulated autophagy) on intestinal homeostasis, intestinal microbiota and defense against AIEC, and (iii) identify bacterial species and their metabolites that could exert beneficial effects on intestinal homeostasis via modulation of autophagy. This project will thus contribute to a better understanding of the etiology of CD and, in the future, to the development of personalized therapies based on autophagy modulation.
