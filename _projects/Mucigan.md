MUCIGAN. Role of mucinophilic bacteria and CARD9 in IgA Nephropathy 

IgA nephropathy (NIgA) is one of the most common kidney diseases worldwide and represents a major cause of renal failure that is associated with microbial infections at mucosal sites. We highlighted that the microbiota of NIgA patients is associated with increased proportions of certain bacterial taxa compared to patients with other chronic kidney diseases. Levels of Akkermansia muciniphila are significantly correlated with circulating degalactosylated IgA1 levels in the faeces of NIgA patients. These results suggest a link between microbial dysbiosis and NIgA.
We aim here to explore the relationship between A. muciniphila, Gd-IgA1 and CARD9 using a transgenic mouse model and patient samples. Our objectives are to: 1. characterize the gut microbiota in patients and in alpha1KICD89Tg mice. 2. define the role of mucinophilic bacteria in NIgA pathogenicity. 3. Characterize the role of CARD9 and CD89 in dysbiosis. 4. Develop new treatments in alpha1KICD89Tg mice.
