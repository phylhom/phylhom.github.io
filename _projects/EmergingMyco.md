EmergingMYCO. Emerging mycotoxins: a new risk for humans and animals? 	
	
Mycotoxins produced by certain molds contaminate more than 70% of cereals worldwide, posing health problems. In humans, low to moderate doses can cause growth retardation, immune dysfunction and contribute to the development of cancer. In animals, they often lead to reduced performance. In Europe, climatic conditions favor contamination by molds of the Fusarium genus, which main toxins (deoxynivalenol, fumonisins, zearalenone) are regulated in foodstuffs for humans and animals. However, Fusarium produces other mycotoxins (beauvericin, enniatins, apicidin, aurofusarin...), less described and known as emerging mycotoxins. Since they are not routinely assayed, little is known about their occurrence. Their toxicity is also poorly understood. This project aims to (i) carry out a large-scale survey of the presence of emerging mycotoxins in French cereals and determine the relationship between their concentration and farming practices, and (ii) assess their impact, alone or in mixtures with regulated mycotoxins, on humans and pigs. In particular, we are studying their effects on intestinal and hepatic functions and on intestinal microbiota using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models.
