TrilliAED. The gut microbiome associated with anti-epileptic drug response in children with epilepsy [funded by ANR 2019]	
	
Antiepileptic drug resistance is a major burden for patients and society, with around 25% of the world's 70 million epilepsy patients being drug-resistant. 	
"The objectives of the TrilliAED project are to: i) assess the link between the gut microbiome and the response to antiepileptic drugs (AED, ~30 molec.) in children, ii) understand the early role of this microbiome in the response to AEDs, iii) determine whether and how certain microbial profiles could maintain or enhance the efficacy of AEDs, also minimizing adverse effects and iv) stratify patients in order to propose appropriate therapeutic options early in the development of the disease by implementing an innovative ""microbiomic"" approach improving the efficacy of these important and affordable molecules."
