GUMME. Effects of endocrine disruptors on children's gut microbiota: the gut-brain communication axis [funded by ANR 2017]	
	
The overall aim of the GUMME project is to contribute to understanding the links between early exposure to EPs (PFCs, phenols, phthalates), the gut microbiota and neurodevelopment up to age 3.	
Specific objectives are :	
"????????? to provide a description of the gut microbiota and its evolution in the first 3 years of life in large cohorts of the general population and confirm an effect of PFCs on gut microbiota (confirmatory analysis);"	
"XXXXX to describe a possible influence of phenol and phthalate exposure on gut microbiota in childhood (exploratory analysis);"	
XXXXX  to describe the effect of chemicals on in vitro cultures of affected gut microbiota members.	
XXXXXX To characterize the link between childhood microbiota and neurodevelopment and carry out a mediation analysis quantifying the proportion of the possible effect of EPs on neurodevelopment influenced by variations in intestinal microbiota.	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Antiepileptic drug resistance is a major burden for patients and society, with around 25% of the world's 70 million epilepsy patients being drug-resistant. 	
	
"The objectives of the TrilliAED project are to: i) assess the link between the gut microbiome and the response to antiepileptic drugs (AED, ~30 molec.) in children, ii) understand the early role of this microbiome in the response to AEDs, iii) determine whether and how certain microbial profiles could maintain or enhance the efficacy of AEDs, also minimizing adverse effects and iv) stratify patients in order to propose appropriate therapeutic options early in the development of the disease by implementing an innovative ""microbiomic"" approach improving the efficacy of these important and affordable molecules."
