Given the potential importance of MAIT cells in protection from microbial infections at epithelial surfaces, we investigate the maturation dynamics of MAIT cells in relation with gut microbiota diversity and function during the neonatal period. Our study combines multiparametric phenotypic and functional characterization of MAIT cells with microbiota analysis (high throughput sequencing, metagenomics, Rib microbiology) to determine how the presence or functionality of MAIT cells is influenced by the gut microbiota, and vice versa.
