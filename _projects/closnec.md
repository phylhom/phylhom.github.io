Ulceronecrotizing enterocolitis (ECUN) is a digestive pathology affecting premature infants with a high morbi-mortality. Although its pathophysiology remains poorly understood, bacterial intestinal colonization of the premature infant is a risk factor. Bacterial involvement in ECUN is based on the fermentation of undigested lactose in the small intestine by colonic bacteria, leading to hyperproduction of metabolites involved in the genesis of lesions. The clinical signs of ECUN are consistent with a clostridial etiology. In animal models of ECUN, these bacteria, frequently isolated from samples of ECUN cases, cause digestive lesions linked to the hyperproduction of butyric acid, a product of lactose fermentation.
Our aim is to demonstrate the biological involvement of clostridia in the etiology of ECUN by comparing the microbiota of premature infants who have or have not developed ECUN, and to search for biomarkers of pathogenicity. This project will provide new clinical and mechanistic data with a view to improving the management and prevention of this dramatic digestive disease of the very premature.
