[http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/projet-anr/?tx_lwmsuivibilan_pi2%5BCODE%5D=ANR-13-PRTS-0018)](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/projet-anr/?tx_lwmsuivibilan_pi2%5BCODE%5D=ANR-13-PRTS-0018)

Ulceronecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a digestive pathology affecting premature babies with high morbidity and mortality. If its pathophysiology remains poorly known, bacterial intestinal colonization of prematurity is a risk factor. The bacterial involvement in NEC is based on the fermentation of undigested lactose in the small intestine by colonic bacteria leading to hyper-production of metabolites involved in the genesis of lesions. The clinical signs of NEC are consistent with a Clostridian etiology. These bacteria, often isolated from samples from NEC cases, cause in NEC animal model digestive lesions related to hyperproduction of butyric acid, lactose fermentation product.

Our goal is to demonstrate the biological involvement of clostridia in the etiology of NEC by comparing the microbiota of premature infants with or without NEC and to search for biomarkers of pathogenicity. This project will bring new clinical and mechanistic data in order to improve the care and prevention of this dramatic digestive disease of the premature baby.
