"[Grand Défi Ferments du Futur](/projects/ferments-du-futur/)" Day at the agriculture showcase was a great opportunity for experts in the field to come together and discuss their work. One of the highlights of the day was a roundtable discussion on the INRAE stand, which featured the Food Microbial Ecology team.
